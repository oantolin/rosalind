#+title: Solutions to Rosalind problems

[[https://rosalind.info/about/][Rosalind]] is a collection of programming puzzles inspired by
bioinformatics. This repo has my solutions to some of the problems. I
might eventually use a mix of languages but for now they are all in
[[https://codeberg.org/ngn/k][ngn/k]] (most of the early Rosalind problems are one-liners in that
language).
